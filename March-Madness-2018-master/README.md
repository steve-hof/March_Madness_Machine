# Machine Learning to Predict the NCAA Tournament

### This README needs a lot more work. I promise more is coming, haha.

This was inspired by the yearly kaggle competition. I didn't quite complete it in time to submit (by 15 minutes) but it served as a fantastic learning space for data cleaning, sports analysis, and machine learning. My model combined elo scores and a combination of advanced metrics that were calculated from the basic data supplied by the competition.

NOTE: I used code written by others as a base for this project. I will list them soon! Many apologies for the delay.
