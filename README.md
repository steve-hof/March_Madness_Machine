# Machine Learning to Predict the NCAA Tournament

### This README needs a lot more work. I promise more is coming, haha.

This was inspired by the yearly kaggle competition. I didn't quite complete it in time to submit (by 15 minutes) but it served as a fantastic learning space for data cleaning, sports analysis, and machine learning. My model combined elo scores and a combination of advanced metrics that were calculated from the basic data supplied by the competition.

NOTE: I started out basing much of my pre-processing code on  [Adit Deshpande's](https://adeshpande3.github.io/adeshpande3.github.io/Applying-Machine-Learning-to-March-Madness) 2017 bracket model and can't thank him enough for all of the wonderful tutorials he's put together. I ended up going in a different direction as far as choice of inputs and algorithms, however.

I calculated some advanced stats on a per posession basis and combined that with an elo ranking input based on the regular season which was inspired by the fact that [thefivethirtyeight.com](https://fivethirtyeight.com/sports/)uses elo ratings for many of it's sports prediction models. For help in coding the regular season elo ratings, I consulted [Kasper P. Lauritzen's](https://www.kaggle.com/kplauritzen/elo-ratings-in-python) kaggle post.
